machine learning:
	algo to auto learn from data
	predictive performance, scalability, and autonomy
artificial intelligence: a subfield of CS; computer programs that can solve problems humans are good at
machinen learning: a subfield of AI, focused on learning from data
neural networls: a parametric model used in ML; based on biological neurons
deep learning: neural networks with multiple layers
data science: an emerging eld which applies ML techniques to domain-specific 

types of ML:
supervised learning:
	have labeled examples of correct behavior
semi-supervised learning:
	learning system interacts w/ the world and leans to maximize a scalar reward signal
reinforment learning: 
unsupervised learning:
